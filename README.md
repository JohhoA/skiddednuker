YOU are responsible if you use this bot to nuke a Discord server. And no, you are not able to be banned by Discord if you do this since it is the admin who invited the bot who will have willingly added it. Please only use this on your friends' servers or a testing server and on someone who can take a joke. WE do not recommend using this on a community server and any griefs will stay on your record.
